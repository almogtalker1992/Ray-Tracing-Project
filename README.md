# Ray-Tracing-Project
First assignment in basic Computer Garphics course I took.

Original source code of the assignment is inside "rayTraserGLFW.zip",
and inside "assignment1.zip" are the files in which you should extract and replace in order to see the results.

Also I attached a readme.txt file that contains instructions for changing scenes and applying bonuses.
* in order to show different scenes you should each time name single txt file as "scene.txt" and paste it in "\rayTraserGLFW\rayTraserGLFW\res" folder.

For more details please consider reading assignment1.pdf.
